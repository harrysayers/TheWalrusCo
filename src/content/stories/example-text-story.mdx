# The Rise of Streaming Music

Over the past decade, streaming has fundamentally transformed how we consume music. What started as a convenience has become the dominant force in the music industry.

## The Numbers Tell the Story

In 2015, streaming accounted for just 34% of music industry revenue. By 2024, that figure had jumped to 84%. This shift represents one of the fastest transformations in media consumption history.

### Key Findings

- **Global Reach**: Over 600 million people now subscribe to music streaming services
- **Revenue Growth**: Streaming revenue grew by 400% between 2015-2024
- **Artist Impact**: Independent artists now earn 40% of their income from streaming platforms

## Changing Listening Habits

The average listener now discovers 5x more new artists per year compared to the CD era. Algorithmic recommendations and curated playlists have replaced radio as the primary discovery mechanism.

### What This Means for Artists

For emerging artists, streaming has democratized access to audiences. A bedroom producer in Seoul can reach listeners in São Paulo without a record label. However, the economics remain challenging - artists typically earn $0.003-$0.005 per stream.
